Problem Statement
  We are given two tables, Visits and Transactions. The Visits table contains information about customer visits to a mall, and the Transactions table contains data about transactions made during those visits. 
  We need to find the IDs of the customers who visited the mall without making any transactions and count how many times they had such visits.

Approach:
  1. Identify Visits Without Transactions: We start by identifying visits where no transactions were made. This can be done by checking which visit_id in the Visits table does not appear in the Transactions table.
  2. Join the Tables: Perform a left join between Visits and Transactions using visit_id to find out which visit_id from the Visits table is not present in the Transactions table.
  3. Count No-Transaction Visits: Once we have identified the visit_id without transactions, group the result by customer_id and count the number of such no-transaction visits.
  4. Return the Result: The result will contain customer_id and the count of no-transaction visits (count_no_trans).

Why It Matters:
  This query is useful for analyzing customer behavior in malls. Identifying customers who frequently visit without making transactions can help in understanding customer engagement and targeting specific 
  marketing strategies to convert visits into sales.
