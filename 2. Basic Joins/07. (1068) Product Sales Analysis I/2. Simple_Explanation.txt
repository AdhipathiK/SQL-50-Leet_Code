Problem Statement:
  We are given two tables: Sales and Product. The Sales table contains records of product sales, including the product ID, year of sale, quantity, and price per unit. The Product table holds product information, 
  including the product ID and the corresponding product name.
  The task is to write a query that outputs the product_name, year, and price for each sale from the Sales table, by joining it with the Product table based on product_id.

Approach:
  1. Join the Tables: The Sales table contains product_id, which is the foreign key that references the Product table. We will perform an left join between the Sales and Product tables using this product_id to 
  fetch the product name for each sale.
  2. Select Relevant Columns: From the joined tables, select the product_name from the Product table, and year and price from the Sales table.
  3. Return the Result: We will return the results in any order as per the problem requirements.

Why This Matters:
  This query is important because it demonstrates how to efficiently combine data from multiple related tables to get more meaningful insights. Joining tables based on foreign key relationships is a common operation 
  in databases and is essential for generating reports or analyzing data across different entities.
