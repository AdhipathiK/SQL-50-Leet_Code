Problem Statement:
  We are given a table of products, where each product has two important properties: whether it is low fat and whether it is recyclable. 
  Our goal is to find the products that are both low fat and recyclable, and return only their IDs.

Approach:
  1. Explore (Table):
  The product information in a Table, which is similar to a spreadsheet in how it stores data in rows and columns.
  
  2. Condition Checking:
  For each product, we need to check if both the "low fat" and "recyclable" properties are marked as 'Y' (Yes). If both conditions are true, we keep that product.
  
  3. Extracting the Product IDs:
  Once we identify the products that meet both conditions, we extract their "product_id" as our final result.

Why This Matters:
  This approach is efficient because it allows us to automate the process of finding products with specific properties. Instead of manually going through the data, 
  we let the computer handle the search and filtering, which saves time and ensures accuracy.
