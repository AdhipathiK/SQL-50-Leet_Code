Problem Statement:
  We have a table called Customer that contains information about customers, their names, and whether they were referred by another customer. Each customer may have a referee_id, which tells us who referred them.
  Our task is to find the names of customers who were not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Approach:
  1. Identify Non-referred Customers:
  We look for customers where the referee_id is not 2 But, we need to include null (meaning they weren’t referred by anyone).
  
  2. Return the Names:
  Once we filter out the customers who were referred by id = 2, we return the names of the remaining customers.

Why This Matters:
  This problem demonstrates how we can filter data based on specific conditions. By using this approach, we can quickly find the relevant information without manually checking each customer, making it a faster and more 
  efficient process.
