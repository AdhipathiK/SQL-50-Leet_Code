Problem Statement
  We have a Weather table containing information about daily temperatures, with each record including a unique id, a recordDate, and a temperature. Our goal is to find the id of dates where the temperature 
  was higher compared to the previous day.

Approach
  1. Left Join on Previous Date:
  The LEFT JOIN operation on Weather w1 with Weather w2 checks if each recordDate in w1 has a matching previous day (recordDate - INTERVAL 1 DAY = w2.recordDate). This means that each row in w1 will look 
  for a match in w2 that is exactly one day before.
  2. Filtering on Higher Temperatures:
  After finding rows where w1.recordDate is one day after w2.recordDate, the WHERE clause filters to only those records where the w1.temperature is greater than w2.temperature.
  3. Selecting the IDs:
  Finally, only the id of the dates in w1 where the temperature is higher than the previous day is selected, and it is labeled as Id.

Why This Matters
  This type of query is useful in various scenarios involving sequential or temporal data analysis:
  Weather Analysis: Identifying temperature trends and anomalies can help with weather forecasting and climate research.
  Time Series Analysis: This pattern can extend to other fields where analyzing values relative to their previous occurrences, like stock prices or sales data, provides insights into trends and fluctuations.
