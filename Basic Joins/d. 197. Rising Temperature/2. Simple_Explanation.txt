Problem Statement:
  We have a table called Tweets with two columns: tweet_id and content. The task is to find the IDs of the tweets that are considered invalid. A tweet is invalid if the number of characters in the content exceeds 15.

Approach:
  1. We need to identify the rows where the length of the content column is greater than 15.
  2. Using the SQL LENGTH() function (or LEN() depending on the SQL variant), we can calculate the length of the content for each tweet.
  3. We will select the tweet_id for rows where the length of the content is greater than 15.

Why This Matters:
  Ensuring that tweets meet character limits is critical for maintaining consistent user experiences, database optimization, and respecting the platform's constraints.
  Identifying invalid tweets helps in validating data and preventing issues in social media apps where character limits are enforced.
