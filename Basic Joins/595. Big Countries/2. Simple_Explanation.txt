Problem Statement:
  We are given a World table containing information about various countries, including their names, continents, areas, populations, and GDPs. A country is classified as "big" if it either:
  Has an area of at least 3 million kmÂ² (i.e., 3,000,000).
  Has a population of at least 25 million (i.e., 25,000,000).
  The goal is to write a SQL query that retrieves the names, populations, and areas of the big countries that meet at least one of the above conditions.

Approach:
  1. Filter the rows of the World table based on the given conditions for area and population:
  The area should be at least 3 million (area >= 3000000).
  The population should be at least 25 million (population >= 25000000).
  2. Select the columns name, population, and area from the filtered rows.
  The SQL query will use a WHERE clause to filter the rows based on either of the two conditions using the OR operator. Once filtered, we will return the required columns.

Why This Matters:
  This type of query is useful in data analysis when categorizing or identifying specific groups based on certain criteria, such as large countries by area or population.
