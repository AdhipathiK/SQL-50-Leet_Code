# SQL & Pandas Problem Solving - Data Analyst Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository showcases my solutions to **LeetCode SQL problems** using both **SQL** and **Pandas**. It is part of my journey towards becoming a proficient **Data Analyst**, leveraging the skills Iâ€™ve acquired through education and professional experience.

## About Me

I am an experienced **Data Analyst** and a current **MSc Data Science** student at **Manchester Metropolitan University**. I have a proven track record of analyzing and visualizing complex datasets, creating dashboards to drive data-driven decisions. I am certified in **Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900)** and proficient in a wide range of data engineering and analytical tools. You can find more about my professional background on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adhipathi-kannan).

## Problem Solving Approach

In this repository, I solve **50 SQL problems** from LeetCode using both **SQL** and **Pandas**. My approach includes:

1. **Problem Statement**: Description of the problem as given on LeetCode.
2. **Explanation**: Detailed explanation of the logic and approach used.
3. **Pandas Solution**: Python-based solution using Pandas for equivalent logic.
4. **SQL Solution**: Query-based solution.

## Learning Goals

This repository is a reflection of my learning path, where I aim to:

- Improve SQL querying and optimization techniques.
- Gain proficiency in **Pandas** for Python-based data manipulation.
- Strengthen my understanding of **data analysis** and **problem-solving** approaches.
- Build a comprehensive portfolio to demonstrate my analytical skills.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For querying and data manipulation.
- **Python (Pandas)**: For solving problems in a Pythonic way using dataframes.
- **LeetCode**: A platform for practicing coding problems.
